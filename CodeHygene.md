1. NO SEMICOLONS EVER
2. Single quotes
3. Tab indent of 2 spaces
4. camelCase filenames

1. Watch your indentation!

## Git branches

**Repo names are camelCase**

1. prod - the production branch
2. main - the default branch
3. dev - the branch to work in
4. dev-{FEATURE_NAME} - if additional features are added to the project, starting a new branch name dev-{explanatory name} can help with development
